Changes in version 0.4 (2016-04-26)

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
* The parameters and the output of "readAntares" have been modified. The output has now only three components: nodes, links and clusters. If the user asks other information like hydro storage or links capacities, they are added to the corresponding component. The corresponding parameters now expect TRUE/ FALSE instead of a vector of node or link names.
* "getLinks" has now same parameters and behavior than "getNodes" 

NEW FEATURES:
* "readAntares" has a new argument "mustRun"
* "removeVirtualNodes" has been finalised
* New alias "nosum" to remove "min", "max", and "std" columns when "synthesis=TRUE" in "readAntares"

Changes in version 0.3 (2016-04-14)

NEW FEATURES:
* "readAntares" can now read hydro storage, hydro storage maximum power, reserve and links capacity
* New function "readAntaresNodes": read all the desired data for a set of nodes
* New function "readBindingConstraints"
* New function "changeTimeStep": change the timestep of an "antaresOutput" object or any table containing a variable timeId
* New function "getNodes": select and filter nodes of an antares study
* "extractDataList" has been improved for better compatibility with PPSE scripts
* Improved documentation
* New function removeVirtualNodes (still experimental)
* Added this NEWS file :)

Changes in version 0.2 (2016-04-05)

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
* "readOutput" has been renamed "readAntares"

NEW FEATURES:
* "readAntares" can now read thermal availabilities
* "setSimulationPath" now reads simulation parameters
* "setSimulationPath" now accepts path to a study and eventually asks the user to choose an output
* Nodes and sets are now separated in "readAntares" and "setSimulationPath"
* aliases for groups of variables in parameter "select" of "readAntares"
