Changes in version 0.6 (2016-05-27)

NEW FEATURES:
* readAntares and readInputTS always add time columns (time, day, month, hour). changeTimeStep now keeps them if they are present.

BUGFIXES:
* readAntares may not work when some MC years were not exported by Antares.
* The construction of the weeks was wrong when a year did not start on january.
* The import of inputs was wrong when the study was not conducted on a whole year but on a smaller period.
* In removeVirtualNodes, option "reassignCosts" was not working correctly.


Changes in version 0.5 (2016-05-11)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* To be consistent with Antares, 'node' has been replaced by 'area' everywhere in the package.
* Column 'MWh' is now named 'production' when reading clusters output.

NEW FEATURES:
* new function 'readInputTS' to read input time series (without output time series)
* 'setSimulationPath' now accepts two new values for the argument "simulation": 0 and "input". These values indicate that the user is not interested by the results of any simulation and only wants to read input data.
* changeTimeStep now accepts for parameter 'fun' a vector of function names that indicate how to aggregate/disagregate each column.
* getAreas has a new argument "withClustersOnly" to select areas containing clusters
* readAntares can now also add input time series to districts like it does for areas

BUGFIXES:
* 'copyToClipboard' was copying the word "txt" instead of copying data
* 'removeVirtualNodes' was not creating some columns for production virtual nodes.
* The option 'mustRun' in readAntares was not functionning correctly


Changes in version 0.4 (2016-04-29)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* The parameters and the output of "readAntares" have been modified. The output has now only three components: nodes, links and clusters. If the user asks other information like hydro storage or links capacities, they are added to the corresponding component. The corresponding parameters now expect TRUE/ FALSE instead of a vector of node or link names.
* "getLinks" has now same parameters and behavior than "getNodes" 
* Parameter "trace" has been removed in "setSimulationPath".

NEW FEATURES:
* "readAntares" has a new argument "mustRun"
* "removeVirtualNodes" has been finalised
* New function "simOptions" to get either global simulation options or simulation options used by "readAntares" to create a given object
* New alias "nosum" to remove "min", "max", and "std" columns when "synthesis=TRUE" in "readAntares"
* "setSimulationPath" has a new argument "simulation" to choose a simulation by name or by order inside an antares project
* New function "getDistricts"
* New function "copyToClipboard"
* Added package vignette


Changes in version 0.3 (2016-04-14)

NEW FEATURES:
* "readAntares" can now read hydro storage, hydro storage maximum power, reserve and links capacity
* New function "readAntaresNodes": read all the desired data for a set of nodes
* New function "readBindingConstraints"
* New function "changeTimeStep": change the timestep of an "antaresOutput" object or any table containing a variable timeId
* New function "getNodes": select and filter nodes of an antares study
* "extractDataList" has been improved for better compatibility with PPSE scripts
* Improved documentation
* New function removeVirtualNodes (still experimental)
* Added this NEWS file :)


Changes in version 0.2 (2016-04-05)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* "readOutput" has been renamed "readAntares"

NEW FEATURES:
* "readAntares" can now read thermal availabilities
* "setSimulationPath" now reads simulation parameters
* "setSimulationPath" now accepts path to a study and eventually asks the user to choose an output
* Nodes and sets are now separated in "readAntares" and "setSimulationPath"
* aliases for groups of variables in parameter "select" of "readAntares"
