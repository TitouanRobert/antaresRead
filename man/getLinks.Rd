\usage{
getLinks(select = NULL, exclude = NULL, regexpSelect = TRUE,
  regexpExclude = TRUE, internalOnly = FALSE, opts = simOptions(),
  ignore.case = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{select}{Character vector. If \code{regexpSelect} is TRUE, this vector is
interpreted as a list of regular expressions. Else it is interpreted as a
list of node names. If \code{NULL}, all nodes are selected}

\item{exclude}{Character vector. If \code{regexpExclude} is TRUE, this vector is
interpreted as a list of regular expressions and each node validating one
of them is excluded. Else it is interpreted as list of node names to 
exclude. If \code{NULL}, not any node is excluded.}

\item{regexpSelect}{Is \code{select} a list of regular expressions ?}

\item{regexpExclude}{Is \code{exclude} a list of regular expressions ?}

\item{internalOnly}{if TRUE, only links that connect two nodes from the list are returned. 
If not, the function may return links that connect a node from the list with 
a node outside the list.}

\item{opts}{list of simulation parameters returned by the function 
\code{\link{setSimulationPath}}}

\item{ignore.case}{Should the case be ignored when evaluating the regular
expressions ?}
}
\value{
character vector containing link names.
}
\description{
This function find the name of the links connected to a set of node.
