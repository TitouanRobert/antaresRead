\usage{
extractDataList(x, nodes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class "antaresData" or "antaresTable" created by the function
\code{\link{readAntares}}}

\item{nodes}{character vector containing the name of nodes to keep in the
final object. If \code{NULL}, all nodes are kept in the final object.}
}
\value{
a list of data.tables with one element per node. The list also
contains an element named "nodeList" containing the name of nodes in the
object and a table called "infos" that contains for each node the number
of variables of diff√©rent type (values, details, link).
}
\description{
This function converts an "readAntares" object in the data structure used
by PPSE : instead of having one table for nodes, one for links and one for
clusters, the function creates a list with one element per node. Each element
is a data.table containing the data about the node and one column per cluster
of the node containing the production of this cluster.
